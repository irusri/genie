**GenIE-CMS Development**  
This is the Development and the latest version of GenIE-CMS. Our main goal is to add admin interface where users can easily create database plus integrate different types of data, create new pages and menus, configure tools and changing website layout by using Themes.

As we mentioned in [this](https://plantgenie.gitbook.io/meeting/diary/october-2018#15th-of-october) document, we have two ways to start GenIE-CMS:

1.) [Using the Docker image](https://github.com/irusri/Docker4GenIECMS)   
2.) [Using standalone webserver](https://geniecms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_updates.html)

However, We need to have an error free CMS to running in the backend to compatible with both above situations.
